__1. Why did I become a data scientist?__

- I always had great interests in numbers since high school. I took all possible math related courses, and got some decent grades. Then I got myself into two programs at Queens University: economics and statistics. From there, I fell in love with logics and programming. I have coded in numerous languages. My stats degree at the University of Toronto has reinforced my analytical skills. Math, stats, and programming really helped me to become who I am today. 

__2. What do I do as a data scientist?__

- I work for a multinational company. It is a manufacturer so I have years of experience in manufacturing data. The data source can come from anywhere in the plants and be in any shape/type. It can be in text such as inventory descriptions or time series data that comes in seconds. Since our company introduced Spark, I have a better tool to deal with large datasets. 

__3. What tools do I use to analyze data?__

- My company recently got into Databricks that is built on Spark. Since we have so much data, Spark is a great tool. Spark can understand Scala, SQL, R, and Python. I learned R in school, but I use Python more at work.

__4. How is my daily life like as a data scientist?__

- I have to say. I am very busy everyday! We have so much data, but not enough time to analyze them all! 

__5. Why do I like my job?__

- I am very curious. I want to know what story is the data trying to tell me. Nowadays, we are all working from home to avoid COVID-19. With the Internet, our team continues to meet everyday. There are a lot of experienced folks on my team. I am very happy to learn new things from them.
