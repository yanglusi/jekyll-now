## Interview Myself (COVID-19 STAY AT HOME VERSION)

1. Why did I become a data scientist?
I always had great interests with numbers since high school. I took all possible math related courses, and got some decent grades. Then I got myself into two programs at Queens University: economics and statistics. From there, I fell in love with the logics and programming. I have coded in numerous languages. Math, stats, and programming background really helped me to become who I am today. 

2. What do I do as a data scientist?
I work for a multinational company in America. It is a manufacturer so I have years of experience in manufacturing data. The data source can come from anywhere in the plants and be in any shape/type. It can be in text such as inventory descriptions or time series data that comes in seconds. Since our company introduced Spark, I have a better tool to deal with large datasets. 

3. What tools do I use to analyze data?
My company recently got into Databricks that is built on Spark. Since we have so much data, Spark is a great tool. Spark can understand Scala, SQL, R, and Python. I learned R in school, but it was not efficient with data engineering. 

4. How is my daily life like as a data scientist?
I have to say. I am very busy everyday! We have so much data, but not enough time to analyze them all! 

5. Why do I like my job?
I am very curious and I want to know what story is the data trying to tell me. I want to make an impact with numbers. Nowadays, we are all working from home to avoid COVID-19. With the Internet, I am still able to connect to my team. We have a lot of experienced people on my team. I am very happy to learn new things from them.
